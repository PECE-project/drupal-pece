# Platform for Experimental and Collaborative Ethnography (PECE)

PECE is a Free and Open Source (Drupal-based) digital platform that supports
multi-sited, cross-scale ethnographic and historical research. PECE is built
as a [Drupal distribution](https://www.drupal.org/documentation/build/distributions)
to be improved and extended like any other Drupal project.

This repository contains the **development code** for PECE. It has work in progress which
is intended to be used by developers to suggest bug fixes and improvements,
as well as a starting point for customizations of the platform. If you are a
developer wishing to contribute to the development process, this is the
repository you must use.

If you are an end-user looking for stable PECE releases, please access the repository
[PECE-distro](https://github.com/PECE-project/pece-distro), which contains our
installation package with the latest stable version. If you have general questions about
the platform, please refer to our [complete documentation](https://pece-project.github.io/drupal-pece/).

## Prerequisites

PECE development is made easy by using the following software projects:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) JavaScript runtime;
- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) task runner;
- [Drush](http://docs.drush.org/) command line interface;
- [Kraftwagen](http://kraftwagen.org/) Drush extension;
- [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/requirements).

Keep in mind that these are prerequisites for the *development environment* of
the PECE project, not for the end-user software. In other words, you will
not need to follow these instructions if you are only interested in installing
and running PECE. Please, refer to our [official
documentation](http://pece.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) if you are
looking for instructions for regular PECE installation and usage.

Find more information on how to run **PECE development environment with Docker** at the end of this file.


### Installing Node.js

We strongly suggest you to use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to install Node.js on your development machine. You must have Node.js version 4.x.x and *npm* version 3.x.x, at least.

**1. To install *nvm*** run the following on you terminal:

```sh
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.31.0/install.sh | bash
```

After doing so, you will probably have to open a new terminal to have *nvm* available as a command. Visit nvm's [official installation guide](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#install-script) if you have any questions.

**2. To install Node.js version 4.x.x** run the following on you terminal:

```sh
nvm install 4.x.x
nvm use 4.x.x
```

Alternatively, you can first clone this repository, change to it's directory, and run `nvm install`. The file ``.nvmrc` will inform *nvm* which version of Node.js it should install and automatically set it as currently version to use.

**3. To install the required version of *npm*** you must run the following on your terminal:

```sh
npm install -g npm@3.x.x
```

To check if everything went smoothly, run the following on your terminal:

```sh
node --version # should echo a number starting with 4
npm --version # should echo a number starting with 3
```

### Installing Gulp

Even though Gulp is not a hard requirement for installing PECE's development
version, it is currently the main tool for running common tasks which are
inconvenient if not automated. We strongly suggest you install it to ease
installation process and avoid mistakes. Keep in mind that the following
[Getting started](#getting-started) guide will use Gulp. Consider having a look at the full [list of the available tasks](gulp/tasks/README.md).

Gulp is a Node.js package that provides an executable, and can be easily installed with the following command:

```sh
npm install -g gulp
```

After doing that, `gulp` command should be available in your terminal. If you find any trouble, please refer to Gulp's [official installation guide](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md).

### Installing Drush

To properly install Drush please follow the [official installing guide](http://docs.drush.org/en/master/install/).

### Installing Kraftwagen

Kraftwagen also provides an [official installation guide](http://kraftwagen.org/get-started.html#installation). Unfortunutelly, we currently use a forked version of the project. You can still follow the instructions on the official installation guide, but the `git clone` should come from [Taller's fork](https://github.com/TallerWebSolutions/kraftwagen/tree/local_workflow_improvements), on the *local_workflow_improvements* branch.

Terminal steps to install:

1. Move to Drush install directory.

```sh
cd ~/.drush
```

2. Clone the Taller fork version of Kraftwagen.

```sh
git clone -b local_workflow_improvements --single-branch git://github.com/TallerWebSolutions/kraftwagen.git
```

3. Make Drush knows you've installed a new module.

```sh
drush cc drush
```

Using Kraftwagen is an important part of the build process. Please make sure you understand its concepts before proceding to the next steps.

## Getting Started

If you follow these instructions you will get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. Proceed to the **Deployment** to learn how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Download

To download the project, simply clone it to your directory of choice as follows:

```sh
git clone git://github.com/PECE-project/drupal-pece.git
cd drupal-pece
```

### Installing dependencies

PECE dependends on a bunch of Node.js packages, which will mostly help building PECE, and Bower packages, which refer to the front-end libraries we use. To install all of these dependencies you can run the following command:

```sh
npm install
```

After installing Node.js dependencies, *npm* will automatically perform Bower 'install'.

### Build

Kraftwagen - the tool behind PECE building system - relies on the concept of different *environments* upon building. The two environments in use are:

- **production**
- **development**

> In the Drupal installation process, the environment config will be responsible for enabling/disabling specific modules. Furthermore, using the *development* environment will also cause for the directory structure to use the *src* directory, using *pece* Drupal profile, inside Drupal's root directory - this means that you can actively engage development using this directory without having to build every time you change something. This technique was introduced as a [pull-request](https://github.com/kraftwagen/kraftwagen/pull/46) to the Kraftwagen project.

Kraftwagen provides many commands through the drush interface. We encapsulate some of them inside 'gulp tasks' with the intend to ease the building and configuration steps.

#### 1. Setup the Kraftwagen workspace:

```sh
gulp setup
```

You'll then be prompted to define the environment (defaults to production) and the posterior database configuration.

> The database configuration provided here is only used to connect to the database, not to create it; prior to proceeding with the install you should make sure to create the database and make it properly available via the settings provided on this step.

#### 2. Download Drupal and contributed modules to build the distro:

```sh
gulp build
```

#### 3. Configure the server

Now you should have the directory *build* already created as Drupal's root. You should go forward and configure Apache, Nginx, or whichever HTTP server you find best. Remember to point the site's root directory to the *build* directory, not to the cloned repository's root.

#### 4. Setup permissions

Drupal requires you give permission for the HTTP server user to write to the files directory. This is a crucial step in order to continue the installation process. Pre and post-configuration steps must be taken in order to ensure that proper permissions are set. Please refer to the [official Drupal documention on how to properly setup the permissions](https://www.drupal.org/documentation/install/settings-file) in your server backend. 

#### 5. Installing Drupal

There are currently two methods for installing a new PECE instance: via command-line or using the web browser.

##### 5.1 Using the browser

In your browser, access the url `/install.php`, preceded with the domain serving the site. The install process is self-explanatory. Keep in mind it takes a while to finish (up to 30 minutes on low-end configuration servers).

##### 5.2 Using the command-line

There is a one-command install available through Gulp. Keep in mind that this command will erase any currently available data on the database configured on step 1. To proceed, run the following:

```sh
gulp site-install
```

> If the user running the Gulp task differs from the user which is being used by the web server, you will need to redo step 4 in other to make sure the server has proper permission to manage files.


#### 6. (Optional) Adding demo content

PECE comes with a script to add some testing content. To execute it, run:

```sh
gulp demo
```

Alternatively, you can do it in your browser by accessing Configuration > Development > PECE Demo (or `/admin/config/development/pece/demo`). This route will only be available if you configured the environment to *development* or if you enabled `pece_demo` module.

## Running the tests
