### What is the difference between a memo, a photo essay, and a PECE essay?

A memo is a first draft of a piece of writing that may be published on
the site. Upon publishing a memo, that memo is opened for comments from
the platform’s community.

A photo essay is a collection of image artifacts, ordered into a
slideshow, with text added for context. For an example of a photo essay,
see [here](http://theasthmafiles.org/content/6-united-states-environmental-health-governance-timeline)

A PECE essay is a collection of artifacts, memos, and essays, organized
into a collage, with text added for context. For an example of a PECE
essay, see [here](https://disaster-sts-network.org/content/lead-poisoning-and-information-distribution-southern-california/essay)
