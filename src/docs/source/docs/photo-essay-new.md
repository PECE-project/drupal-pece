On this page you will find a grid of options for creating different forms of new content followed by their brief descriptions. "Photo Essay" is one type of content, located in the "Curate" section. A photo essay is a collection of image artifacts, ordered into a slideshow, with text added for context.


2. Click “Photo Essay”

5. Once this artifact is added, click “Add Photo essay item.” Repeat Step 4 for your remaining Image Artifacts.


6. Next, scroll down to the metadata fields. The menu bar on the left side will automatically be open to the "Permission, Authorship, and Groups" section. Your screen name should already appear in the first contributor field. Listed contributors have the ability to edit the content, and are also credited as content contributors when the content is published. To add the names of any other project members who you would like to grant access to editing the artifact, type the first few letters of their name into the other “contributor” field. To add more than one additional contributor, click the "add another item" button and enter their name in the new field.

7. Next, scroll down to the "View Permission and Groups" section. The button switch will automatically set viewing permissions to "Everyone can view this content," making the artifact visible to all internet users. If you want to restrict access to the content, click the button switch to turn this off. If you choose to leave the toggle on, you can still associate the content with a particular group. To do so, complete the "Group association and view access." You can select a group with which to associate the content by typing its name into the field. If you choose to restrict access to the content, you can designate specific people or groups that will have view access. To allow specific people viewing access, in the field, "People with view access" type the first few letters of their name and select their username. Add groups whose members should have view access to this memo by typing the group name into the "Group association and view access" field. Note that if you give a group view access, it will also associate the content with that group. This means the content will appear on the group's page.

8. Next, fill out the "Contribution Metadada" section, making sure to select the correct license and add any critical commentary. For the license, we encourage you to leave it as Attribution, Share Alike CC BY-SA, but you can choose any of the other Creative Commons license as you see fit. Descriptions of available creative commons licenses can be found here.

Tag the content. As you type, suggested tags will be automatically generated if they exist already in the system. We recommend following theses suggestions and using existing tags if they are not too different from what you were intending, but feel free to make up new tags!
