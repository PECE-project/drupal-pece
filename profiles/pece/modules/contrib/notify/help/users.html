<p>To manage your own notification preferences, click on the
“Notification settings” tab on your “My account” page.</p>

<p>The “Master switch” overrides all other settings for Notify. You
can use it to suspend notifications without having to disturb any of
your settings under “Detailed settings” and “Subscriptions”.</p>

<p>The “Detailed settings” determine what is included in each
notification.  You can turn on or off notification of new content and
new comments.</p>

<p>The “Subscriptions” panel allow each user to manage individual
notifications by content type.</p>

<p>Note that for users with the permission “administer notify queue”,
it is possible to subscribe to content types that are not generally
available for subscription.  This allows administrators to
monitor <em>all</em> new content on the site, without making it
subscribable for non-administrators.</p>
