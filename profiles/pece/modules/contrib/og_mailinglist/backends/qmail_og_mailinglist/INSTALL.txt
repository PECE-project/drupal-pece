These files are for integrating OG Mailinglist with the QMAIL MTA.

# Installation Instructions (Only tested on Plesk 8.6.0 system, documentation for other systems is welcome). These instructions assume root access.

1. Create a domain for the email side of OGM with a "catchall mailbox" for all mail to the domain (eg groups@group.example.com). For Plesk 8.6.0 tutorial see http://www.webhostingresourcekit.com/flash/plesk-8-linux/plesk8linux_catchall.html - if you are not using Plesk you can also refer to http://www.lifewithqmail.org/lwq.html

2. Copy the og_mailinglist_exim4_transport.php file from the exim_og_mailinglist folder into the home dir for the mailbox and set the ownership to be popuser:popuser using the chown command.

eg /var/qmail/mailnames/group.example.com/groups

3. In the home dir of the  mailbox, create a .qmail file containing the following lines:

|preline ./og_mailinglist_exim4_transport.php group.example.org >> ogmtransport.log
./Maildir/

The first line pipes the incoming email into the test@group.example.com group and appends script output to the ogmtransport.log file. (You may want to remove this after you get your script running correctly, or change >> to > to only save the output from the last time it is run)

The second line also archives the email for troubleshooting/archival purposes. (You may also want to remove this line after you get your script running correctly)

4. Create a file called sites_info.php in the mailbox home dir containing the following, tailored for your site(s).

<?php

/*
* @return array of sites w/ associated POST urls.
*/
function og_mailinglist_site_info() {
  return array (
    'example.com' => array(
            'post_url' => 'http://example.com/og_mailinglist',
            'validation_string' => 'get this from /admin/config/group/mailinglist and paste here',
           ),
    'example.org' => array(
            'post_url' => 'http://example.org/og_mailinglist',
            'validation_string' => 'get this from /admin/config/group/mailinglist and paste here',
           ),
  );
}

5. Test setup by sending email to a test group's email on your site e.g. test-group@group.example.com
