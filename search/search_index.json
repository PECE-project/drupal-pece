PECE provides a place to archive and share primary data, facilitates analytic collaboration, and encourages experimentation with diverse modes of publication. The platform encourages humanities scholars to experiment with digitally-mediated, interdisciplinary collaboration, provides opportunities to involve students and practitioners in humanities research as it progresses, and quickens the public availability of humanities research in an open access form. PECE also enables experimentation with new forms of peer review for humanities research, and functions as a portal to a suite of open source tools useful for humanities research, including tools developed in data science for other scientific communities. At its core, PECE is an experimental system. PECE\u2019s design is both theoretically inflected and ethnographically grounded: platform design has been oriented by \u201cdesign logics\u201d drawn from cultural, social, and language theories. We intend for the system to be as user-friendly as possible, but also acknowledge that conventional modes of knowledge organization tend to overdetermine the structure and meaning of knowledge, history, and culture. The way we have deliberately chosen to organize content in PECE may feel unfamiliar and disorienting to some, but we hope that in choosing to use PECE, you are as excited as we are to engage in this experiment.

This thread of work in cultural anthropology has drawn on literary and language theory to address the significance of genre forms both in everyday enactment of culture in different settings, and in scholarly representations of culture. PECE extends this thread of work into the digital domain through a platform design that reflects critical insight from theories of language, literature, and ethnography, built out organically with original ethnographic material. Thus, while designed to reflect critical theory, PECE is also ethnographically grounded, collaborative in nature, and expressly experimental: the platform is designed to permit change as called for by evolving ethnographic engagements. This entwined development process has been challenging but has proven robust, allowing us to identify needs and explore computational possibilities from within humanities work, learning about and building the kinds of tools that are critical when ethnographers work collaboratively, especially on complex topics involving multiple sites, scales and actors, and many different kinds of \u201cdata.\u201d We work on PECE aware of long-standing effort, often experimental in tenor, to integrate new technologies and media into the work and expression of cultural analysis. Gregory Bateson and Margaret Mead\u2019s stunning work with photography \u2013 as both a research tool and means of conveying their analysis \u2013 comes immediately to mind (Bateson and Mead 1942; Jacknis 1988). The history of filmmaking in the conduct and expression of cultural analysis has also laid important ground, generating impressive methodological debates and innovation, and a body of work that literally provides different angles on matters of interest and concern to cultural analysts. Digital tools and modes of presentation add still other possibilities for getting at and sharing understanding of how \u201cculture\u201d works \u2013 in historical, geographic, political, economic and media context, always in need of deeper or alternative ways of understanding. The goal of PECE could be described as kaleidoscopic, enriching cultural analysis through use of an ever-evolving array of techniques and technologies \u2013 which, together, multiply perspective, give texture to insight, and animate reflexivity.","title":"About"},{"location":"about/#background","text":"The PECE project extends from work in cultural anthropology over the last few decades that foregrounds how cultural critique, innovation and change emerge, and the significance of the genre forms through which culture is expressed (Marcus and Fischer 1986; Clifford and Marcus 1986).

Recognition of diversity within the humanities and even the empirical humanities is foundational to the project. The specific focus of the PECE project is on the challenges associated with poststructural, postcolonial and feminist theories of language, knowledge and politics. The PECE project works to delineate the work flows and practices that reflect scholarship in this vein, and the ways digital infrastructure can support them. The PECE project also aspires to develop collaborative capacity among scholars, mobilizing poststructural understanding of the dynamics through which communication and knowledge are engendered. The research questions that orient the PECE project include the following: What work flows, data types and analytic modes characterize experimental ethnography? What theories and assumptions about language, meaning, knowledge and sociality undergird experimental ethnography?

Technically, a structured analytic is a tag that gets applied to an analytic. So let\u2019s say that you have the question: \u201cWhat is the main argument of the article?\u201d and you want to add it to a structured analytic called \u201cAnalyzing a research paper.\u201d In PECE, \u201cAnalyzing a research paper\u201d would be a tag that the user associates with the question. By structuring the structured analytic as a tag (rather than a folder or some other encompassing structure), users can associate their questions with more than one structured analytic without having to duplicate the question in multiple structured analytic folders. Because of this, in order to create a structured analytic, the user should simply create an analytic and add a new tag (by clicking on the green \u2018+\u2019 next to the list of question sets). The user will be directed to a new form where they can name the structured analytic and add a description. Once the analytic is saved the structured analytic will be added to the list of structured analytics with which analytics can be associated. How do I create an analytic? Navigate to \u2018Dashboard\u2019. This link is listed in the main menu. Under the \u2018Add Content\u2019 heading, select \u2018Analytic\u2019. You will be directed to a web form to create the content. Enter the relevant fields. Select the structured analytic that the analytic will be added to. If you would like to add the analytic to a new structured analytic, follow the instructions for creating a new structured analytic . Save the content. How do I annotate an artifact? Navigate to the artifact you would like to annotate. Click the \u2018Annotate\u2019 button below the artifact. Select a \u2018Structured Analytic\u2019 (set of questions) that you will use to annotate the artifact, and click \u2018Continue\u2019. Select a question to respond to, and click \u2018Continue\u2019. To add a question, Select Create new , enter the question title in the field that appears, and click \u2018Continue\u2019. Enter the relevant fields, and click \u2018Save and Continue\u2019. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until finished annotating and then click \u2018Finish\u2019. Frequently Asked Questions What is the difference between a structured analytic, an analytic, and an annotation? Analytic : An analytic is a question designed to elicit various viewpoints about the artifact. Structured Analytic: A structured analytic is named set of organized questions (or analytics). Annotation : An annotation is a user's response to an analytic. Do I have to answer all of the questions for a certain structured analytic when annotating an artifact? No, you can skip a question. When creating an annotation, if I hit Save and Continue, and then decide I do not want to answer another question, there is no button for \u2018Finish\u2019 from the window that lists structured analytics or the window that lists analytics. Will I lose all of my work if I close out of the window? No, as soon as you hit Save and Continue, the response to your question is saved. You can now close out of the window or \u2018Cancel\u2019 at any point without losing your previously saved work. How do I edit an annotation? PECE users should be able to edit their own annotations from any interface where their annotations are displayed by clicking on the \u2018Edit Annotation\u2019 button. See How do I access my annotations? . How do I edit an analytic? The titles of analytics should not be edited for any reason. Since all questions on the platform are shared, and users may have already used the question to annotate an artifact, changing the text of the question could comprise the context of existing annotations on the platform. To add the analytic to another structured analytic, navigate to the page for analytic, and click the \u2018Edit\u2019 tab. Check the box for the structured analytic to which you would like to add the analytic. How do I see a list of all existing structured analytics? In the newest update to PECE, navigate to the \u2018Analyze\u2019 link. This link will be listed in the main menu. A list of all existing structured analytics will appear here. How do I see a list of all analytics in a given structured analytic? In the newest update to PECE, navigate to the \u2018Analyze\u2019 link. This link will be listed in the main menu. A list of all existing structured analytics will appear here. Click on the structured analytic to be directed to a list of analytics that have been designated a part of that structured analytic. How do I access my annotations? There are a few options for accessing annotations. Navigate to your \u2018Dashboard\u2019 and click on the tab for \u2018Annotated Artifacts\u2019. Navigate to an artifact that you\u2019ve annotated. Under the rendered file and the \u2018Annotate\u2019 button, you will see a list of users that have annotated the artifact. Click on your username to see your annotations of the artifact. Navigate to the \u2018Analyze\u2019 link in the main menu. Click on a structured analytic you\u2019ve used to annotate an artifact and a question that you\u2019ve used to annotate an artifact. You can then filter this page to your username to see the annotations that you\u2019ve created from this question. How do I see how others annotated an artifact? Navigate to the artifact. Under the rendered file and the \u2018Annotate\u2019 button, you will see a list of users that have annotated the artifact. Click on a username to view their annotations. From the page that lists the user\u2019s annotation of an artifact, you can also click on a question to see how multiple users responded to that question for the artifact. How do I see all of the responses to a particular analytic? In the newest update to PECE, navigate to the \u2018Analyze\u2019 link. This link will be listed in the main menu. A list of all existing structured analytics will appear here. Click on the structured analytic to be directed to a list of analytics that have been designated a part of that structured analytic. Click on the analytic to view all responses to the analytic. From here you can filter the responses to a particular user\u2019s responses or to responses to a particular artifact. How do I see all of the responses to a particular analytic for a given artifact? See How do I see all of the responses to a particular analytic? How do I see all of the responses to a particular analytic created by a given user? See How do I see all of the responses to a particular analytic? I annotated a Private or Restricted artifact, and my annotation is appearing in both Search and on Tag pages. Shouldn\u2019t my annotation be Private or Restricted if it is responding to a Private or Restricted artifact? Yes, it should. Unfortunately, right now, all annotations default to Open. Annotation Etiquette There are several important things to remember when creating analytics for the platform. All analytics are shared by everyone across the platform. As soon as you create an analytic, it is available to everyone in the platform to use for annotating any artifact. PECE has been designed to take advantage of this. As diverse users respond to the same set of questions, it becomes possible to juxtapose answers to questions. Therefore, You should avoid creating questions that respond to only one artifact or are relevant to only a very specific fieldsite within a broad structured analytic . For instance, you should avoid adding a question like, \u201cHow has the Obama administration\u2019s Open Government Directive influenced the New York City open data policy?\u201d under a structured analytic called \u201cProfiling a Policy.\u201d Instead, a question like, \u201cHow have existing policies and directives influenced the structure and content of this policy?\u201d would be accessible to many users on the platform to annotate many artifacts about diverse policies. More specific questions should all be categorized into Structured Analytic . A question like \u201cHow has the Obama administration\u2019s Open Government Directive influenced the New York City open data policy?\u201d would be appropriate in a structured analytic called \u201cProfiling the New York City open data policy,\u201d which could be useful if a set of researchers were all going to be annotating artifacts related to the New York City open data policy. It can be valuable to use the structured analytic headings to cordon off more specific questions so that certain groups can respond to the same set of questions. For instance, in The Asthma Files , we have one Structured Analytic called \u201cSpecial Issue for Transport Policy.\u201d A group of researchers created this analytic so that they can share a set of questions for annotating each other\u2019s abstracts for a special issue to which they were all contributing articles. While these questions were not relevant to any other users on the platform, categorizing the questions under the \u201cSpecial Issue for Transport Policy\u201d structured analytic, separated these questions out from other more general questions. Be sure to navigate the existing structured analytics by clicking on \u2018Analyze\u2019 in the main menu before creating a new analytic or structured analytic. If you see questions or sets of questions similar to the ones you were planning to create, gauge whether there is analytic value to create a separate analytic. If you do create a separate analytic, it will not be possible to juxtapose the responses to this question to the responses the similar questions you identified. This is a tradeoff that you will need to consider. If a question is relevant to more than one structured analytic, categorize it under both structured analytics following these instructions. Do not duplicate the analytic to categorize it under a separate structured analytic.","title":"Annotations"},{"location":"annotations/#annotations","text":"For an overview of how to annotate artifacts, please see the following YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/edit?o=U video_id=bB2X8lZWyVY","title":"Annotations"},{"location":"annotations/#how-do-i-create-a-structured-analytic","text":"Technically, a structured analytic is a tag that gets applied to an analytic.

All analytics are shared by everyone across the platform. As soon as you create an analytic, it is available to everyone in the platform to use for annotating any artifact. PECE has been designed to take advantage of this. As diverse users respond to the same set of questions, it becomes possible to juxtapose answers to questions. Therefore, You should avoid creating questions that respond to only one artifact or are relevant to only a very specific fieldsite within a broad structured analytic . For instance, you should avoid adding a question like, \u201cHow has the Obama administration\u2019s Open Government Directive influenced the New York City open data policy?\u201d under a structured analytic called \u201cProfiling a Policy.\u201d Instead, a question like, \u201cHow have existing policies and directives influenced the structure and content of this policy?\u201d would be accessible to many users on the platform to annotate many artifacts about diverse policies. More specific questions should all be categorized into Structured Analytic . A question like \u201cHow has the Obama administration\u2019s Open Government Directive influenced the New York City open data policy?\u201d would be appropriate in a structured analytic called \u201cProfiling the New York City open data policy,\u201d which could be useful if a set of researchers were all going to be annotating artifacts related to the New York City open data policy. It can be valuable to use the structured analytic headings to cordon off more specific questions so that certain groups can respond to the same set of questions. For instance, in The Asthma Files , we have one Structured Analytic called \u201cSpecial Issue for Transport Policy.\u201d A group of researchers created this analytic so that they can share a set of questions for annotating each other\u2019s abstracts for a special issue to which they were all contributing articles. While these questions were not relevant to any other users on the platform, categorizing the questions under the \u201cSpecial Issue for Transport Policy\u201d structured analytic, separated these questions out from other more general questions. Be sure to navigate the existing structured analytics by clicking on \u2018Analyze\u2019 in the main menu before creating a new analytic or structured analytic. If you see questions or sets of questions similar to the ones you were planning to create, gauge whether there is analytic value to create a separate analytic. If you do create a separate analytic, it will not be possible to juxtapose the responses to this question to the responses the similar questions you identified. This is a tradeoff that you will need to consider. If a question is relevant to more than one structured analytic, categorize it under both structured analytics following these instructions. Do not duplicate the analytic to categorize it under a separate structured analytic.","title":"Annotation Etiquette"},{"location":"artifacts/","text":"Artifacts Steps to Create an Artifact The process of adding any variety of content to PECE begins by logging in with your screen name and password and clicking \u201cDASHBOARD\u201d in the top right corner. You should now see your Dashboard page. Across the top of the page, in the different tabs you can find the groups to which you currently belong, along with any artifacts or essays that you have created. Along the right side of the page, you will find a list of options for creating different forms of new content. \u201cArtifacts\u201d are one type of content. An artifact is the basic working unit of PECE; once, created, artifacts are then used in photo essays (for image artifacts only), timelines, or PECE Essays (both of which accept images, video, documents, and any other type of artifact) You can add many types of artifacts, including audio files, video, images, pdf, text, and websites. Click the \u201cArtifacts\u201d drop-down menu (the third option in the \u201cAdd Content\u201d column) to see the list of options. Next, click the type of artifact you want to create. You should now have access to all of the fields you need to fill out in order to create a new image artifact. First, type the title of your image in the \u201cTitle\u201d pane. Add yourself as a contributor by typing the first few letters of your name into the \u201ccontributor\u201d field. Your screen name should pop up. Select your name. Repeat this process with the names of any other project members who you would like to grant access to editing the artifact. Next, write out your \u201cCritical Commentary\u201d section, making sure to follow any project- specific instructions. Next, upload your artifact by clicking the \u201cBrowse\u201d link. The browser window should pop up. Click \u201cBrowse\u201d and select the name of the file you would like to upload. Click \u201cOpen\u201d and then \u201cNext\u201d to upload the file into PECE. Depending on the size of the file it may take a few seconds or minutes to upload; a small icon for the file will appear once uploading is complete. Add Alt Text and Title Text as desired. Click Save. Next, cite the source of the artifact in the Source pane, using your platform's preferred citation format. In the \u201ccreators\u201d pane, credit all the contributors who helped produce the image. You may also include the format, language, or fieldsite associated with the image if you feel as though they are important or interesting to the meaning or usefulness of the image. Otherwise you may choose to leave them blank. For the license, we encourage you to leave it as Attribution, Share Alike CC BY-SA, but you can choose any of the other Creative Commons license as you see fit. Please refer to the Licensing section for more information. If the image is not ready to be made public, you can alter the permissions of the image. Selecting \u201cPrivate\u201d limits visibility to you and you alone. Selecting \u201cRestricted\u201d limits visibility to users of PECE designated as \u201cResearchers\u201d (this mostly matters to instances of PECE subject to IRB protections). Selecting \u201cOpen\u201d make the artifact visible to all internet users. For more information, see Content Permissions section. To designate the content as part of a group, select the group's name in the Group Audience field. Select \u201cPublic\u201d to make it accessible to all viewers; this is the setting we generally recommend. Select \u201cPrivate\u201d to limit visibility to Group Members. Tag the content. As you type, suggested tags will be automatically generated if they exist already in the system. We recommend following theses suggestions and using existing tags if they are not too different from what you were intending, but feel free to make up new tags! Only add an expiration date if it is important for the artifact to be deleted from the platform at some point. Finally, scroll back up to the top of the page and click \u201cSave\u201d to save your work. And remember: all of these settings can be revised at time: private artifacts can be made public later, and vice versa, for example. Frequently Asked Questions What is the difference between a text artifact and a field note? A text artifact and a fieldnote are technically very similar. However, unlike a text artifact, a fieldnote will not have a title; the date the fieldnote was created will become the title. Also a fieldnote will appear in the field diary on user\u2019s dashboard. If associated with a group, a fieldnote will also appear under the Field Diary tab of the group\u2019s page, ordered by the date created. What is an artifact bundle, and why would I use it? An artifact bundle is an artifact that links to several other existing artifacts. You can create an artifact bundle so that you may annotate a group of artifacts together. What is \u201ccritical commentary\u201d? In this field, you should provide commentary on the artifact that documents its significance as an ethnographic objects and why it is relevant to the platform. See sections on the Source field , and Licensing for more information about attribution of artifacts. How do I select a file that has already been added to the system? When creating a piece of content, under the Image Upload field, click the \u2018Browse\u2019 button to select a file from the existing PECE library. Select the \u2018Library\u2019 tab. Choose a file and hit the \u2018Submit\u2019 button. How do I list the creator (author, photographer, composer) of a piece of content when they are not part of the system? When creating an artifact, the Creator field can be used to designate the author of a piece of content when that creator is not a user of the system. Technically, this field is a tag. This means that if content in the system has already been tagged with the creator, you should be given the option to select this creator\u2019s name when you begin typing in this field. Otherwise, upon saving the artifact, the creator\u2019s name will become a new \u201cCreator tag\u201d in the system. How do I add a fieldsite to an artifact? First the fieldsite needs to have already been added to the platform. See How do I add a fieldsite ? for instructions on how to do this. When I edit content, what should I include in the revision log message? If a researcher cites a piece of content on the platform on a particular date, and then the content creator revises the content on a later date, it is important to be able to track which version of the PECE content the researcher was citing. PECE enables users to track changes made to content over time. In the revision log message section, users should summarize changes they make the content, so that it is easier to track the changes. See Where can I access older versions of content? for where to track these changes. Where can I access older versions of content? When logged in, navigate to the content. Click on the \u2018Revisions\u2019 tab. If there is no \u2018Revisions\u2019 tab, it means that no changes have been made to the content. Under the \u2018Revisions\u2019 tab, you can click on a date - time under the Revisions column to access older versions of the content. You can also compare a newer version of content to an older version by selecting two versions under the Compare column and clicking the \u2018Compare\u2019 button. I\u2019ve identified my content as having multiple contributors, but those contributors don\u2019t have access to edit the content. What\u2019s going on? Identifying contributors only credits those site users involved in contributing the content. It does not grant those users access to edit the content. Only the content creator can edit the content. Where can I find my fieldnotes? Navigate to your \u2018Dashboard\u2019. This link will be in the main menu. On your dashboard, there will be a tab labeled \u2018Field Diary\u2019. Click on this tab to access your fieldnotes. They will be ordered chronologically. Why do my published images appear blurry? Currently, when images are uploaded to PECE, the files are compressed, and the image quality downgrades. If this is a problem for your content, you should reach out to your site administrator and ask to have the quality upgraded. Can I download files from the platform? You cannot download files that are listed as All Rights Reserved. Please see the Licensing section for more information about this. Audio files and video files that have been added as a part of Open artifacts can be downloaded from the platform. Navigate to the artifact page where the file is displayed. In the bottom right hand corner of the rendered file, there will be an upside down arrow. Click this button to download the file. PDF files that have been added as part of Open artifacts can also be downloaded from the platform. Navigate to the artifact page where the file is displayed. When you hover over the PDF viewer, a bar will display at the top. In the upper right hand corner of this bar, there will be an upside down arrow. Click this button to download the file. Right now, there is not a simple way to download image files. You can right click on the image and Save the file to your computer however. Can I add a Youtube or Vimeo video to the platform? Currently, you cannot embed a YouTube for Vimeo video in the platform. Can I add a map to the platform? Currently the only way to share a map on the platform is by capturing an image of it and uploading it to the site as an image artifact, or alternatively by uploading a link to the map as a Website artifact.","title":"Artifacts"},{"location":"artifacts/#artifacts","text":"","title":"Artifacts"},{"location":"artifacts/#steps-to-create-an-artifact","text":"The process of adding any variety of content to PECE begins by logging in with your screen name and password and clicking \u201cDASHBOARD\u201d in the top right corner.

A fundamental goal of PECE is to bring the Open Source and humanities communities together on equal footing and mutual respect for differences. In that regard, we hope PECE is as interesting and successful as an Open Source project in its own right as it is a platform for social scientists. We are committed to all contributions, large and small. PECE works best as an experimental space for technical and non-technical people alike. As our technical and non-technical communities grow, we envision the collaboration between the two leading to greater insights from all. PECE is dedicated to the long-term. PECE relies upon open web standards to guarantee interoperability and avoid vendor lock-ins and Open Data to encourage and create infrastructural conditions to promote data sharing in contexts of little to almost nonexistent collaboration among research groups --- and, last but not least, Open Access to advance the goals of returning public funded research to the public. In practical terms, PECE applies these concepts by: Enforcing the usage of open data and open document formats (such as open, web safe formats for multimedia files; open formats for documents such as the ODF, and established web standards such as JSON, XML, and RDF for data exchange and relationality); Providing technical conditions for data sharing by enforcing the usage of flexible copyright licenses, such as Creative Commons suite, when applicable for ethnographic data; Contributing code directly to Drupal projects, instead of forking code and working locally and not sharing bug fixes and improvements with the larger user and developer community; Participating and actively contributing to Free and Open Source projects as well as initiatives for Open Access in anthropology and STS, therefore bridging the Free and Open Source community efforts with academic disciplines and transdisciplinary contexts; Drawing from the orientation of the Open Data community regarding best-practices for data sharing and open inter-exchange formats; Following the community work for debating and creating \"codes of conduct\" Guidelines for New Contributors At this point, PECE is much more advanced and sophisticated in its theoretical underpinnings and specification, rather than in its actual implementation. The implementation follows from the general orientation of our design logics and our of the necessity of specific \"substantive logics\". So it is a good idea for any new contributor to pay attention to the verbose theoretical parts to understand what the platform wants to accomplish with the same attention one would pay to the data model, the APIs we use, and other technical specifications. Mark Seemann has an interesting post on how to better organize \"pull requests\". In the same spirit, we welcome pull requests that: Are kept small, doing one and only one thing Do not change the coding style, which follows the Drupal community . Lines are kept below 80 columns for readability Are tested and made sure it is ready for merging with a clean commit history Clearly explain what you trying to accomplish and why you are contributing a change Submitting your Contribution When submitting your contribution, it is good form to stick to a basic template which has been developed by the Drupal community to communicate issues and requested changes: What is the motivation for this request? What solution do you propose? Are there remaining tasks? What are they? What part of the platform is impacted? API, data model, UI, etc.?

In practical terms, PECE applies these concepts by: Enforcing the usage of open data and open document formats (such as open, web safe formats for multimedia files; open formats for documents such as the ODF, and established web standards such as JSON, XML, and RDF for data exchange and relationality); Providing technical conditions for data sharing by enforcing the usage of flexible copyright licenses, such as Creative Commons suite, when applicable for ethnographic data; Contributing code directly to Drupal projects, instead of forking code and working locally and not sharing bug fixes and improvements with the larger user and developer community; Participating and actively contributing to Free and Open Source projects as well as initiatives for Open Access in anthropology and STS, therefore bridging the Free and Open Source community efforts with academic disciplines and transdisciplinary contexts; Drawing from the orientation of the Open Data community regarding best-practices for data sharing and open inter-exchange formats; Following the community work for debating and creating \"codes of conduct\"","title":"Statement on Free and Open Source Software, Open Data, and Open Access"},{"location":"contributors/#guidelines-for-new-contributors","text":"At this point, PECE is much more advanced and sophisticated in its theoretical underpinnings and specification, rather than in its actual implementation. The implementation follows from the general orientation of our design logics and our of the necessity of specific \"substantive logics\". So it is a good idea for any new contributor to pay attention to the verbose theoretical parts to understand what the platform wants to accomplish with the same attention one would pay to the data model, the APIs we use, and other technical specifications.

Since then, the PECE design team has gone through several iterations of the platform. In 2013, we began development of PECE on the content management system Plone; however due to the technical and epistemological challenges that the system posed, we moved to the content management system Drupal in 2014. The first attempt to design PECE with Drupal involved configuring factory standard Drupal features and add-on modules, using administrative menus offered through-the-Web . Using the Features module, we were able to standardize certain configurations on one instance and then push them out to other instances of the platform. However, in order to package PECE into a distribution that could be downloaded and used by any ethnographic project, we realized that we would need to hire developers to formalize our configurations, secure our permissions system, and develop new software modules. In 2015, we hired the Brazil-based Drupal development company Taller to begin developing PECE as a Github distribution. Since 2015, we have formalized a data model, a permissions system, a workflow, and several user interfaces. The first version of the distribution was released in March 2016, and since then we have released 3 updates to the distribution, each offering additional features and improved user interfaces. We also hired the development company Agaric to work on specific modules for PECE in the fall of 2015. Agaric took over development of a module to integrate Zotero feeds with Drupal platforms and developed a module to integrate Archival Resource Keys in Drupal platforms. Both of these modules are available through the Drupal site at https://www.drupal.org/platform-for-experimental-collaborative-ethnography . The Zotero module has been configured and is available in the PECE distribution and the ARK module should be available through PECE shortly. Today, we have one lead developer, Renato Vasconcellos Gomes, working full-time to add new features to the platform.","title":"History"},{"location":"history/#history-of-pece-development","text":"The development of PECE as a stand-alone platform began in 2011. Since then, the PECE design team has gone through several iterations of the platform. In 2013, we began development of PECE on the content management system Plone; however due to the technical and epistemological challenges that the system posed, we moved to the content management system Drupal in 2014. The first attempt to design PECE with Drupal involved configuring factory standard Drupal features and add-on modules, using administrative menus offered through-the-Web . Using the Features module, we were able to standardize certain configurations on one instance and then push them out to other instances of the platform. However, in order to package PECE into a distribution that could be downloaded and used by any ethnographic project, we realized that we would need to hire developers to formalize our configurations, secure our permissions system, and develop new software modules.

PECE is a Free Software-based Drupal distribution, therefore the standard installation procedure for Drupal 7 applies to PECE with a few extra dependencies. The following instructions have been tested on a Debian 8 (jessie) server, but they are not OS-dependent. PECE should run on any system supported by Drupal 7. PECE has been tested in virtual machines with 256M allocated for PHP, being 128M the recommended minimum for Drupal 7 distributions. Your configuration, of course, may vary considerably depending on the usage you are making of the platform. Refer to our data management guidelines under the \u201csustainability\u201d section to learn about the recommended minimum specs for your servers. Downloading the Distro Our distribution is currently being developed on Github. You can obtain the most updated version following the link \u201cReleases\u201d on the project\u2019s git repository: https://github.com/PECE-project/pece-distro Alternatively, you can obtain the source code and build the distro yourself if you intend to help our team by fixing bugs and extending the platform for your research purposes: git clone https://github.com/PECE-project/drupal-pece.git If you are a developer who wants to contribute to PECE, you will need to follow special instructions to install and configure the tools for building the distro. Consult the sub-section Setting up the Development Environment below for more information. Dependencies PECE has extra dependencies in addition to the ones you will need for Drupal 7 core: cURL php-mcrypt (for AES encryption support in backups and user passwords) php-ssh2 (for backup SFTP support, installed via PHP pear) pecl-yaml (for YAML parsing) Quick Install If you have the server backend already set-up, you can quickly install PECE following these steps: Clone the \u2018\u2019pece-distro\u2019\u2019 repository: git clone https://github.com/PECE-project/pece-distro.git Create an empty database: mysql -u $YOUR_USER -p -e \"CREATE DATABASE $YOUR_DB_NAME CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;\" Proceed to the URL in which your Drupal will reside, i.e. https://worldpece.org. From there, you can install PECE like any other Drupal site. Follow the Drupal.org official documentation if you need further help . In the section Troubleshooting below we describe common issues users have when trying to install PECE without the proper backend dependencies, configurations, and permissions. One important note: please, make sure to set the permissions on the filesystem properly. We cannot emphasize this enough. The official Drupal documentation explains how to do so, if you have questions. (In our experience, we have needed to set the file permissions at sites/default/files/artifacts to 770 and sites/default/files/private to 770.) I want to use HTTPS with PECE. How can I do that? A very simple tutorial for setting up HTTPS with Certbot on Ubuntu can be found here . I\u2019ve installed PECE, but none of my links are working. What is going on? Your webserver is not properly configured to support what is called \u201cClean URLs\u201d on Drupal. Make sure you have your httpd \u201crewrite\u201d rules properly set-up. This configuration can be done in the vhost file of your nginx configuration, following the Perusio guide or using the default.htaccess file that is provided by default by Drupal if you are running Apache. I get an error about a YAML parser being missing. How can I fix that? Newer versions of PHP require you to install pecl-yaml for YAML parsing. You can find it here . We recommend using the latest version, which is 2.0.4 at the time of writing. Follow the pecl-yaml instructions to build and install it. Then edit your php.ini file. For example, if you are using PHP 7.2, the file will be found at: /etc/php/7.2/apache2/php.ini Add the following line to php.ini: extension=yaml.so When should the admin login credentials be used? Distribute admin login credentials to as few users as possible. Admin login credentials should only be used to configure settings and to approve new users. The admin credentials should not be used to add content or comment on content. How do I update the site information? Go to \u201cAdministration \u00bb Configuration \u00bb System \u00bb Site information\u201d and fill out the information about your site name, the basic admin password, contact, timezone and other relevant info. How do I upload the terms of service? Go to \u201cAdministration \u00bb Configuration \u00bb People \u00bb Legal\u201d and click \u201cAdd T C\u201d, then fill-out the boxes with your custom text to be displayed to every user who requests an account on the system. How do I set up back-ups? As explained in our data management guidelines, PECE is configured to automatically generate backups. You should, however, revise the settings and set-up a SFTP connection to transfer your backup to another server and ensure that you have extra security when storing your encrypted backups. First, revise the settings we provided, changing whatever you think is needed (say, the most convenient time, when the site is not being used, to generate the backup). Go to \u201cConfiguration \u00bb System \u00bb Backup and Migrate\u201d to perform this first step. Then, click on \u201cDestinations\u201d and \u201cAdd Destination\u201d to set-up the SFTP connection with the credentials of your backup server. Please note that you have to use the port 22 (not 21) and password authentication, since ssh-key authentication is unfortunately not supported yet. How do I configure SMTP so that emails can be sent from the platform? PECE uses Drupal notification for key events on the system. It has to be configured using a regular email address, provided you have all the mail server information. You just need your SMTP server info and credentials to get this done. Go to \u201cAdministration \u00bb Configuration \u00bb System \u00bb SMTP Authentication Support\u201d and provide your SMTP server information, including username and password. How do I increase the file upload limit? While logged-in as an administrator, navigate to Administration Configuration Media File Settings. Under the Maximum Upload Size field, enter a new value (we use 2GB). Click Save Configuration. You may also need to increase the upload limit on the server. How do I update my instance when a new version of the PECE distro is released? Always back-up your files and database before updating the platform. Put the site in maintenance mode. Under sites/default/, there is a file called settings.php. Search for $update_free_access = FALSE; and change FALSE to TRUE. Then, go to YourSite/update.php and follow the steps. In theory major updates are not handled differently, but sometimes issues have occurred. Be sure to turn off maintenance mode when you are done. Other Post-Installation Troubleshooting \u201cTime Out\u201d during installation: this issue is related to the usage of Drupal distributions in \u201cshared hosting\u201d environments which are very limited in terms of the resources allocated per client / user account. If the installation process is interrupted before it is finished, you will have to check your PHP configuration and increase the memory allocation and timeout configuration for the php scripts with the following directives: memory_limit and max_execution_time which can be found in your php.ini file. After doing so, you should not experience more \u201ctimeouts\u201d during installation. Links do not work: your webserver is not properly configured to support what is called \u201cClean URLs\u201d on Drupal. Make sure you have your httpd \u201crewrite\u201d rules properly set-up. This configuration can be done in the vhost file of your nginx configuration, following the Perusio guide or using the default.htaccess file that is provided by default by Drupal if you are running Apache. Permission denied when uploading content: your filesystem permissions must be set accordingly for the public and private directories, since PECE uses both extensively. Follow this official Drupal tutorial to configure the permissions properly for both directories where you installed PECE. Permission denied when uploading content after configuring filesystem permissions: make sure your /tmp is also writable and, if you are on a shared host and cannot have access to it, configure Drupal to point to a temporary directory in your system/files path. There is a discussion about this issue on Drupal.org that is helpful . Cannot create users, server internal error: in our experience, php5-mcrypt is probably not installed in your system.

The contemporary \u2013 globalized, high-tech, anthropogenic \u2013 world generates complex risks and problems at an unprecedented pace \u2013 calling for new levels of operational coordination within and across disciplines, and between researchers and practical decision-makers working at many scales (local to transnational). Researchers thus need to develop modes of work \u2013 and supporting infrastructure \u2013 that enable deep and complex collaborations of different kinds. PECE aspires to provide such infrastructure. Given the complexity \u2013 scientific, technical, cultural, and so on \u2013 of contemporary problems there is a special need to cultivate and sustain different ways of thinking about problems. As feminist theorists have long argued (Keller, Turkle), epistemological pluralism offers the best chance of understanding and figuring out ways to respond to complex problems. Care thus must be taken to keep collaborative practices from being over-determined; collaboration needs to produce and steward what the PECE project has termed \u201ckaleidoscopic logic.\u201d Preserving and extending the special perspectives of humanities researchers on contemporary problems poses particular challenges, partly because of technocratic habits of thinking in many practical decision-making domains. It is thus important to work to extend the practical relevance of humanities knowledge experimentally, drawing on deep (theoretical) insight into the ways meaning, knowledge, and culture \u201cwork.\u201d Experimentation (and testing) is called for in the production, expression, and circulation of humanities knowledge, all of which are supported by PECE. Given the complexity of problems many empirical humanities researchers are concerned with as well as escalating constraints on research funding, humanities researchers need to develop infrastructure and governance for sharing research data. They also need to better \u201cexpose\u201d (in the language of computer sciences) the many stages of humanities knowledge production \u2014 so that there are possibilities for collaboration at all stages, and associated work can be attributed (thus crediting individual contributions in collaborative projects). Work at faultlines between different scales, cultures, and disciplinary communities reliably produces rupture and new lines of work (Traweek), partly because such interaction inevitably troubles established categories and modes of sense making, often producing double-binds (Bateson). The collaborative work supported by PECE thus promises to be vitalizing for the humanities writ large, and particularly the empirical humanities. Post-structural studies and theories of language have demonstrated how stabilized meaning is always partial, forced, and marginalizing (and thus often violent) (Derrida, Spivak, de Lauretis) \u2013 pointing to a need and possibility for productively unstable knowledge infrastructure and practice (Derrida, Spivak, de Lauretis). This is particularly the case in contexts of dramatic change, with enduring and emergent forms of injustice; in such contexts, established paradigms are insufficient for dealing with matters at hand. Poststructural insight thus has particularly relevance today, suggesting the way humanities insight can undergird contemporary efforts to support interdisciplinarity and innovation. PECE is designed to demonstrate this. Given the density of information flows today, laced with conflicts of interpretation and interests, practitioners in many domains need highly developed hermeneutic sensibilities, and a high capacity for collaboration \u2013 not only in carrying out concrete tasks, but also for thinking through what tasks should be carried out, how they should be prioritized, and how problem identification both directs practical work, and quickly makes alternative pathways invisible. PECE provides a space to experiment with and examine different forms of collaboration and thus can result in research findings with clear relevance to capacity building efforts in practitioner communities.
